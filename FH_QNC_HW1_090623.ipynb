    "\n",
    "It depends if we are taking the frequentist vs bayesian approach. I think in the frequentist POV then yes it can be stat significant. With the data set having 1000 HIV tests where some results can be postive, negative or unknown and the hypothesis being that the test can be negative or positive regardless of the person's infection status. A null hypothesis is the probability of false negatives in addition to the probability of false postivies will equal to 0.05. So, with the p-value equal to 0.05 rather than \"<\" indicating significance, the null hypothesis can be rejected and accept a positive test can be statistically significant indicator of HIV+ status."
