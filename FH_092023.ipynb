You want to start by refuting the simple that that the participants' measured ages are not changed by the treatment. What test do you use and why?\n",

There is also continous data because of age as the continuos variable and this test allows to account for that. In this case, we would assume that there is normal distribution due to the age variable. We want to test differences of before and after vaccine and this test allows that. "
